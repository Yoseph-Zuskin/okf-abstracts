# Lesson

A single instructional unit, typically a video, reading or exercise with a focused topic.

## Contract

A concept of this class describes the class itself as a universal — *not* a concrete
instance. Its body defines the contract for instances:

- **What it is** (definition above).
- **Frontmatter** an instance must carry: a distinct `type` value naming this class, plus a
  `subtypes_of` entry `{ type: <Class>, resource: <href>, version: <tag> }` pointing here.
- **Body conventions** expected of instances.

## Implemented by

- Concrete instances in the workspace bundles reference this class via `subtypes_of`.
