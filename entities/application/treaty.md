# Treaty

A binding agreement concluded between states or international organizations.

## Contract

A concept of this class describes the class itself as a universal — *not* a concrete instance. Its body defines the contract for instances:

- **What it is** (definition above).
- **Frontmatter** an instance must carry: a distinct `type` value naming this
  class, plus a `subtype_of` entry `{ type: <Class>, resource: <href>, version: <tag> }` pointing here.
- **Body conventions** expected of instances.

## Implemented by

- Concrete instances in the workspace bundles reference this class via
  `subtype_of`.
